Includes coding challenges presented by Daniel Shiffman: https://natureofcode.com/

Planned, maybe in the near future:

  1. [Verlet integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration), for wire physics and other things.
  2. Get OpenGL working in Java, see JOGL, LWJGL, libGDX.
  3. Inverse Kinematic (IK) implementation sometime.
  4. Starting my own physics engine, this time in Java.
